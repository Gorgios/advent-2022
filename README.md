## advent-2022

In this repo I present my solutions of advent of code 2022 edition - https://adventofcode.com/.
Along with improving my programming skills I want to learn new language this year - Kotlin.

### Diary
#### Day 1
* It was easy warming-up exercise. I didn't experience any problem with both parts.
* Originally done in Java, because I've started with Kotiln from Day3. Rewrote to Kotilin in "oldschool way".

#### Day 2
* Another warming-up exercise, but it required more code (or only I think so ;))
* Learned Kotlin enums and when expressions, very productive day!

#### Day 3
* Declarative programming coming! I've a lot of fun with these tasks and discovered lot of operations on collections

#### Day 4
* Only thing I had to do to solve both parts, was to found intersect function. 
However, I did it already in day3, so everything went smoothly;)

#### Day 5
* I have lot of fun with this task. Learned a little about parsing in kotlin. When input is correctly parsed,
exercise become easy, because there is only need to use stacks correctly. 

#### Day 6
* Interesting puzzle. I went declarative way, but I know that I could make it working faster by iterating in loop 
and using slicing window technique. However, execution took 20 ms, so who worry ;)
