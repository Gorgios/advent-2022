## advent-2022

In this repo I present my solutions of advent of code 2022 edition - https://adventofcode.com/.
Along with improving my programming skills I want to learn new language this year - Kotlin.

### Diary
#### Day 1
* It was easy warming-up exercise. I didn't experience any problem with both parts.
* Originally done in Java, because I've started with Kotiln from Day3. Rewrote to Kotilin in "oldschool way".

#### Day 2
* Another warming-up exercise, but it required more code (or only I think so ;))
* Learned Kotlin enums and when expressions, very productive day!

#### Day 3
* Declarative programming coming! I've a lot of fun with these tasks and discovered lot of operations on collections

#### Day 4
* Only thing I had to do to solve both parts, was to found intersect function. 
However, I did it already in day3, so everything went smoothly;)

#### Day 5
* I have lot of fun with this task. Learned a little about parsing in kotlin. When input is correctly parsed,
exercise become easy, because there is only need to use stacks correctly. 

#### Day 6
* Interesting puzzle. I went declarative way, but I know that I could make it working faster by iterating in loop 
and using slicing window technique. However, execution took 20 ms, so who worry ;)

#### Day 7
* Exercise took more time than I expected, because on first attempt I tried to solve it using map. After some debugging
I realized that two dirs can contains directory with same name (shame on me), so I created simple data structure to solve this problem :) 

#### Day 8
* Very pleasant puzzle, just need to correctly traverse 2D array. Solutions may not look very elegant,
* but I didn't find better way to solve it.

#### Day 9
* Tricky puzzle, my firs part one solution was not suitable for part 2, but after some debugging 
I found how to solve in simple way and make solution generic for both parts. I'm feeling more comfortable with Kotlin every day! 

#### Day 10
* Today's tasks were more easy than puzzle description may indicate. I know that my solution can look 
little bit ugly, but I did not figure out better way to solve it, sorry :)
